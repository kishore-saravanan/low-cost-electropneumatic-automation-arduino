# Low Cost Electropneumatic Automation using Arduino
Arduino code to execute any sequence of operation in two pneumatic double acting cylinders

We have developed an electropneumatic system which can run any sequence of operation just by getting the sequence from the user. There is no requirement of calculating KV map, ladder logic to avoid signal clash in this system. We have developed an Arduino code run any sequence automatically avoiding the signal clash. This is a low-cost solution compared to PLC based automation which would cost in lakhs whereas this system uses Arduino as controller and costs only from 2000 to 3000 (excluding pneumatic components). We have also provided provisions in our system to provide time delay and counter operations making it suited for advanced and complex applications. Cylinders used: 2 Double Acting Cylinders Solenoids used: 2 5/2 24v Double Solenoid operated DCV Controller used: Arduino
